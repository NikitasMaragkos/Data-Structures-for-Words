The purpose of this code is to read from a txt file all the existing words and save them in several data structures so as to compare these data structures. As it reads the context of the txt file it also operates a cleaning process. The corresponding results are presented below.

| Data Structure | Creation Time | Search Time |
| :------: | ----------------- | :--------: |
| Unordered Array | 560 sec | 0.576 sec |
| Ordered Array | 8.88 sec | 0.006 sec |
| Binary Tree | 8.76 sec | 0.027 sec |
| AVL | 8.23 sec | 0.025 sec |
| HashMap | 0.64 sec | 0.003 sec |
| HashMap Linked List| 0.47 sec | 0.001 sec |
